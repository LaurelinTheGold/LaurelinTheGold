## About Me ##

I'm @LaurelinTheGold. I am currently a Masters Student at the University of Pennsylvania, where I am studying Robotics ('23). I also studied at Penn for undergrad, where I majored in Computer Engineering ('22).

I like code that: interacts with the real world[^1], uses cool math[^2] to solve problems[^3], runs fast in software[^4] or hardware[^5], and is correct[^6]

[^1]: robotics, embedded systems

[^2]: Linear Algebra, Calculus, Complex Analysis, etc

[^3]: computer graphics, computer vision, deep learning, robotics

[^4]: Rust, C, C++, maybe even assembly

[^5]: GPUs, ~~FPGAs~~ jk, friendship ended with FPGAs. I would like to learn more about DSPs and OpenCL 

[^6]: ü•∞ strong type systems my beloved ü•∞, ‚ù§Ô∏è Rust and Haskell ‚ù§Ô∏è
